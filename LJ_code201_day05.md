#LJ Code 201 Day 5

We've finished our first week of Code 201! It was definitely intense, but really productive, and I think I've already learned a lot. Day 5, we mostly focused on git branching. Git-- so far at least-- really makes sense to me, and the actual git branching process wasn't too difficult to get my brain around. The hard part was figuring out the logic of the function problems- but by working with my classmates, we were able to put the pieces together and figure it out. I really enjoy pair programming. I think it's a great tool for tackling tricky problems.
