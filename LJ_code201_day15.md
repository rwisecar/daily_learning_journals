#Learning Journal Day 15

Today we got to watch the Code 301 project presentations- which were inspiring and intimidating all at the same time- and get started on our own project. Maelle, Judy, and I are working well together, and I think we have a really good roadmap for our project so far. I hope that we get permission to use the autism risk analysis test from Drexel University, but if not, I'm sure we can find a workaround.
