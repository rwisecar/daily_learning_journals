#Learning Journal Day 20

I did it! I can't believe I finished Code 201. What a great feeling. And I am so incredibly proud of my team, and all the work we accomplished this week. I was so nervous for the presentation- I always am when public speaking- but it went so well. And Maelle was so brave for speaking so openly about her journey with her son's autism. Judy did a great job presenting, too. On to 301!
