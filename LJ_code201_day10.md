#LJ Code 201 Day 10

I'm writing this on Sunday, so I'll speak to both Friday and today. Friday was great- I worked closely with Adrian to create a webpage along a client's specifications. This felt like a real world application, and I think it's something I'm going to try to repeat in my free time. Adrian and I figured out what relative and absolute positioning can actually do for you, which was incredibly helpful.

Today, I refined my cookie stand page. I'm pretty happy with the content and the appearance, though I didn't tackle some of the harder stretch goals. I hope to build more projects like this going forward- either on my own or in class.
