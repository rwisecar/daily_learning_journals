#Learning Journal Day 7

Today went well, I think! I worked with Britt and Adrian to get my table footer to reflect the sum of each table column in the morning. In the afternoon, I spent some time in the sandbox trying to understand how event handlers worked by breaking my code about a million times. I think I have a pretty solid grasp on the basics, at least. I was able to get my form input to populate my allLocations array on my own, and then I worked with Maelle (with lots of hints from Sam) on getting the form input table row to show up only once and in the right place. We figured it out!
