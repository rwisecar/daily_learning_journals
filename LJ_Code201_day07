#Learning Journal Day 07

Today, I learned the importance of reading through the directions all the way. We worked on developing tables through javascript, and I actually really enjoyed solving the problem. The only problem was that the way in which I solved the problem was not the way in which I was *supposed* to solve the problem. This led to another 3 hours of work, but I finally figured it out, with lots of help. I find that I'm falling into a work process that I really like, too. I like tackling the problem by myself first, to see if I can figure out the logic and get it to work. I really enjoy solving these problems. When I hit a wall, it really helps to pull out the headphones and start working with some of my incredibly bright classmates. Getting that new perspective really helps me wrap my head around the issues.
