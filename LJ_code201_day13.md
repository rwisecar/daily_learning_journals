#Learning Journal Day 13

Today was a much better day than yesterday. I had my problem, and I worked both alone and with others to solve that problem (and the dozens of other problems I created by trying to solve the problem). I learned how to make both my bar charts functional today, and how to capture the data in the correct way. I learned how to store data in my browser's local storage for later access, and manipulate that stored data in conditional statements. All in all, an encouraging day.
