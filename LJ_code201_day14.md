#Learning Journal Day 14

Today I learned a lot about GitHub and team workflow today. I'm looking forward to building my final project with Team Death- Maelle and Judy. We established a great workflow with a lot of communication and double checking before pushing to git. I do think I want more practice with JavaScript, but I'm sure I'll get it.
