#Learning Journal Day 19

Today we made a ton of progress. In fact, I think we've got a finished product. Judy is testing one additional stretch feature that we may wind up adding to the site, but otherwise- I think we're good. It's an amazing feeling, knowing that we've created a site from scratch, based entirely off ideas we had, within a week. Very cool. I'm feeling pretty excited about presenting our site to the class tomorrow, and even more excited to see what everyone else came up with.
