#Learning Journal Day 18

Today we made some really excellent progress on our project. We ran into a major issue with our javascript code, such that we had to rewrite a pretty significant portion of it. That was certainly frustrating, but we were able to work together to come up with a solution. Once that was done, we moved on to CSS styling. We already had a basic theme sort of ready for our pages, and I spent a good chunk of my afternoon working on styling those pages. Now we're ready for stretch goals.
