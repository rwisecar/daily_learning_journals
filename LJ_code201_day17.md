#Learning Journal Day 17
I think our group is in pretty good shape. We got a lot of our functionality up and running, and we've been working well as a group to tackle problems as they arise. We've had a couple of communication issues, but I think we largely resolved those. I think we'll be able to have a MVP by the end of Day 18.
