#LJ Code201 Day 02

I feel like I really learned a lot today. I found it incredibly helpful to go through the process of pushing a file to GitHub, and pulling existing files from GitHub... although I am a little worried that I won't be able to get this learning journal up! I guess we'll see.

Sam did say that we would likely learn more in lab than we did in class, and while I'm not sure that's true, I feel like I definitely learned a ton in lab. I feel like I'm filling in the gaps in between what Codecademy started. I'm remembering how to style in CSS, and struggling sometimes with capturing the right element. Positioning is still tough for me. I also struggled with the JS .toUpperCase(). I could not for the life of me figure out where to put it, and my eyes just glazed over a typo when I was trying to debug. I'm sure it'll come together, though.
