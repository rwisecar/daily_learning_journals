#Learning Journal Day 16

Day 16 was great! I got down to work with Maelle and Judy on our project. Before noon, we wrote some pseudocode that wound up being very helpful, and after we pitched our project to Sam and Brian, we started coding. Things are going smoothly so far. We've come across a few challenges, but nothing that we haven't been able to figure out.
