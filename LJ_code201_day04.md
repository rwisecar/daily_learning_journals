#LJ Code 201 Day 4

Today was our first pair programming session. I think it went really well. I worked with Keith, and since we worked together a bit yesterday, a lot of our code was really similar. I started as the navigator, and he was the driver, working on my code.

A lot of today's project was pretty easy- turning each question into a function was relatively straightforward- but we definitely ran into some snags with local and global variables. I had my score keeping code set up with vars that became local variables once each question was turned into a function. We had to figure out how to collect the user input with a global variable, and add a point incrementally with each right answer inside each function. I think it would've taken me a lot longer to figure out how to do this if Keith and I weren't working together. I realized from Sam's Dan Schwartz demo that we could change the value of a global variable inside a function, and Keith figured out how to add a point with each right answer-- score++. Definitely a team effort.

We put in a lot of troubleshooting work into our projects while Keith was driving, and the result was that things went really smoothly when I was driving on Keith's code. All in all, this was a very solid experience.
