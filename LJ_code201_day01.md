 #LJCode 201 Day 1

Today was exciting! My brain feels pretty full right now, though. It was good to review a lot of the info I'd learned on my own in the pre-work.


I feel like I learned a lot-- particularly about Git, GitHub, and Unix. It was really helpful to go through the demos on those topics.


I'm excited to start coding tomorrow.
