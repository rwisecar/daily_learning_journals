#LJ Code 201 Day 11

Today we worked on building our bus mall page. This was a tricky challenge, with a lot of different logic puzzles I worked closely with Adrian and Lee on getting our clicks and displays to tally. I also worked with Britt and Sera during the course of the day. The hardest part for me was figuring out how to capture the displayed and/or clicked object so you could assign a value to it. I'm still working on getting new images to load once an item is clicked. Hope to work on it more tonight, but will probably work on it tomorrow.
