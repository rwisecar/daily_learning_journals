#LJ Code 201 Day 6 Journal

Today was incredibly difficult. I learned a lot though, by trying to figure out how to build the objects and the methods and the for loops. I was really proud of myself, actually, for figuring out a workable solution on my own, even if it wound up not being best practices. Now I know the proper way to structure these kinds of things (pre-constructor, anyway) and I'm sure that will be helpful in the future.
